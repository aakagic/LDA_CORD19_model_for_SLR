       "<br/> <strong>Title</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7248588/\" target=\"_blank\">The Story behind COVID-19: Animal Diseases at the Crossroads of Wildlife, Livestock and Human Health</a> <br/> <strong>Authors</strong>: DE SADELEER, Nicolas; GODFROID, Jacques<br/> <strong>Journal</strong>: nan<br/> <strong>Publish time</strong>: 2020-04-27<br/> <strong>Abstract</strong>: A number of virological, epidemiological and ethnographic arguments suggest that COVID-19 has a zoonotic origin. The pangolin, a species threatened with extinction due to poaching for both culinary purposes and traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, is now suspected of being the “missing link” in the transmission to humans of a virus that probably originated in a species of bat. Our predation of wild fauna and the reduction in their habitats have thus ended up creating new interfaces that favour the transmission of pathogens (mainly viruses) to humans. Domesticated animals and wild fauna thus constitute a reservoir for almost 80% of emerging human diseases (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola). These diseases are all zoonotic in origin. As if out of a Chinese fairy tale, the bat and the pangolin have taught us a lesson: within an increasingly interdependent world, environmental crises will become ever more intertwined with health crises. Questions relating to public health will no longer be confined to the secrecy of the physician’s consulting room or the sanitised environment of the hospital. They are now being played out in the arena of international trade, ports and airports and distribution networks. Simply put, all human activity creates new interfaces that facilitate the transmission of pathogens from an animal reservoir to humans. This pluri-disciplinary article highlights that environmental changes, such as the reduction in habitats for wild fauna and the intemperate trade in fauna, are the biggest causes of the emergence of new diseases. Against this background, it reviews the different measures taken to control, eradicate and prevent the emergence of animal diseases in a globalised world.<br/> <strong>Body text</strong>: Today, the world is facing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus. In February 2020 in China, an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% was estimated for COVID-19. Every day, we are watching in real time the evolution of the pandemic around the world. 1 In March 2020, the centre of the pandemic moved to Europe, then later shifting to the USA in April.\n",
       "Although about 1,320,000 animal species have been identified, scientists estimate the total number of species on earth at more than 10 million. In addition, biodiversity is not distributed evenly across the planet. Generally speaking, on the continents, it increases from the poles towards the equator, whilst in the oceans the increase is much less pronounced, and sometimes operates in reverse.\n",
       "Biodiversity is passing through a period of major crisis. In November 2017, 15,364 scientists from 184 countries signed a \"Warning to Humanity\" published in BioScience expressing their concerns about the future of wildlife. 3 The signatories of this manifesto stressed that humanity is on a collision course with the natural world as ecosystems are being pushed beyond their capacities to support the web of life on this planet. In their wake-up call, they warned us that we are unleashing the sixth mass extinction, 4 in which many forms of life are likely to disappear. With the rate of extinction running at more than 100,000 times the background rate, half of all the world's species could become extinct within a few decades if humanity is unable to endorse \"a more environmentally sustainable alternative to business as usual\". 5 The nature and magnitude of the threats are well known, and they include fragmentation and habitat loss, over-harvesting of fauna, trading in species, etc. Despite past warnings, threats to biodiversity have continued unabated, making it impossible to meet the target of halting biodiversity loss in accordance with the Aichi biodiversity targets set by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (hereafter CBD). 6 As discussed as above, many of these threats compound the spread of viruses among humans.\n",
       "The task of reducing these threats is daunting. Many of the conservation measures undertaken by State authorities have been carried out in accordance with the CBD. Under that Agreement, conservation and sustainable use are regarded as the cornerstones of biodiversity policy. 7 Although conservation is not defined in the CBD, its preamble states that \"the fundamental requirement for the conservation of biological diversity is the in-situ conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats and the maintenance and recovery of viable populations of species in their natural surroundings\". The CBD defines \"sustainable use\" as \"the use of components of biological diversity in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity, thereby maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of present and future generations\". 8 The rationale of the latter concept is that it is possible to use biodiversity in a manner in which ecological processes, species and genetic variability remain above the thresholds needed for long-term viability. 9 As the assessment of the status of biodiversity lies at the core of the CBD, it is important to determine whether biodiversity trends can differ and also what the causes are of these differences. It has recently been demonstrated that biodiversity may rise or fall depending on metrics or taxa. However, few monitoring programmes have the resources needed in order to measure changes to biodiversity components accurately in time and space. It must be considered that, unless greater resources are deployed, there is often a risk of incorrect diversity changes being extrapolated based on individual measurements, regions or emblematic taxonomic groups. 10 While wildlife diseases alone may currently threaten few species, pathogens may be a significant threat to already-endangered species. This would be the case when diseases interact with other drivers such as habitat loss, climate change, overexploitation, invasive species and environmental pollution. 11\n",
       "Founded in 1924, the World Organisation for Animal Health (hereafter OIE, for Office International des Epizooties) is the intergovernmental organisation responsible for improving animal health worldwide. 12 The goal of the founding parties was to put an end to the epidemic diseases (named epizootics) that were devastating their livestock. These objectives are still among the priority missions of the OIE, both for diseases that affect animals only and those also that are transmissible to humans (called zoonoses). For the latter type, collaboration agreements have been concluded with the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations (UN).\n",
       "The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) 13 of the UN is frequently involved in emergency responses triggered by severe animal (infectious) diseases, which have the ability to spread rapidly over large geographical areas (\"transboundary animal diseases\", or TADs) into previously unaffected countries or regions, or by natural and human-made disasters such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, etc. Activities such as early warning and surveillance of emerging diseases are carried out jointly with the OIE.\n",
       "The parties to these two international organisations are required to report \"important\" livestock diseases. However, diseases affecting wildlife that are likely to harbour zoonotic pathogens are reported on a voluntary basis. This entails a risk that some \"important\" diseases may not be duly reported to the two international organisations.\n",
       "In order to understand the control of animal diseases, we shall classify them below according to their respective epidemiology. Each epidemiological category will be illustrated with reference to specific cases. The aim of this section is to highlight that routes of transmission can involve different livestock (eg pigs) and different wildlife species (eg bats). In addition, transmission routes for the same virus are likely to differ over space and time. Accordingly, these transmission routes are fraught with uncertainty. As this article does not seek to be exhaustive, some diseases that have caught the public attention will be mentioned but not developed in detail.\n",
       "Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are designated as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) based on the molecular characteristics of the virus and the ability of the virus to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting. AIVs rarely infect humans, although outbreaks of some AIVs in poultry have been associated with illness and death in humans. 14 The most severe influenza pandemic, the so-called \"Spanish Flu\", was caused by an AIV and is estimated to have caused 20-50 million deaths in 1918-1919. 15 The first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century occurred in 2009-2010 and was also caused by an AIV. Swine influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease in pigs caused by AIVs that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs, but usually cause few deaths. Sporadic human infections with swine flu have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called \"variant viruses\". As pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses, they may potentially be infected with influenza viruses from different species (eg ducks and humans) at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. If this new virus causes illness in humans and can be transmitted easily from person to person, an influenza pandemic can occur. This is what most likely happened in North America when an AIV with swine, avian and human genes emerged in the spring of 2009. 16 Following this pandemic, the WHO International Health Regulations Review Committee declared in 2011 that \"the world is ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic or to any similarly global, sustained and threatening public-health emergency\". The WHO therefore implemented the \"Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework\", 17 a global approach to pandemic influenza preparedness and response.\n",
       "The AIV that caused the 2009-2010 pandemic is now a regular human flu virus and continues to circulate seasonally throughout the world. 14 \n",
       "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which is caused by a picornavirus, affects all clovenhoofed animals, both domesticated and wild. FMD is characterised by fever and blister-like sores on the tongue and lips, in the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves. FMD is a TAD that severely affects the production of livestock and disrupts regional and international trade in animals and animal products. A very severe outbreak of FMD occurred in the UK during 2001, costing in excess of £3 billion, with 6.5 million animals slaughtered during control efforts. The first farm to suffer an outbreak was a pig farm, although the source of the virus remains a mystery. 18 FMD is not zoonotic. forest trees during the El Niño-related drought and fires caused by people in Indonesia in 1997-1998 resulted in the migration of these forest fruit bats to pig farms. 21 In 2001, during NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh, it was shown that ingestion of date palm sap contaminated with saliva or excreta from infected fruit bats was the main spill-over route, with no involvement of pigs as intermediate hosts. During these outbreaks, person-to-person transmission occurred among persons in close contact, including healthcare workers. 22 There is currently no available vaccine.\n",
       "It is believed, but has not been demonstrated, that infection with the Ebola virus occurs initially through contact with an infected animal, such as fruit bats or via intermediate amplifying hosts, such as a non-human primate. 23 After that, the virus spreads from person to person. The largest Ebola outbreak in history was first reported in March 2014 and declared resolved by the WHO on 10 June 2016. In addition to the devastating effects (more than 11,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), the Ebola epidemic severely impacted healthcare services and caused setbacks in the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis, measles and malaria in these countries. 24 At that time, there was no vaccine available. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is currently grappling with the world's second largest Ebola epidemic, with more than 2200 deaths and 3400 confirmed infections since the outbreak was declared on 1 August 2018. Vaccination is being implemented to control the current epidemic in DRC.\n",
       "As far as COVID-19 is concerned, the pangolin, a species threatened with extinction due to poaching for both culinary purposes and traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, is now suspected of being the \"missing link\" in the transmission to humans of a virus that probably originated in a species of bat. 25 Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and more than 200,000 people have died in 210 countries and territories as of 29 April 2020.\n",
       "West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that causes West Nile fever. WNV is spread by the bite of a mosquito infected with the virus, and it quickly established itself in North America following its initial recognition in New York City in 1999. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds that are natural hosts. WNV has a broad host range (more than 30 mammalian host species). In contrast to the position with birds, it does not spread directly between people. Severe disease may occur in horses (up to 40% mortality). 26 A vaccine is available for horses. The plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis is infamous as the cause of the Black Death (1347-1353) and the later Second Pandemic (fourteenth to nineteenth centuries CE), when devastating epidemics occurred throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. It has recently been suggested that human ectoparasites, such as human fleas or body lice, were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death, challenging the assumption that plague was predominantly spread in Europe by rats. 27 Overall, Y. pestis caused three major pandemics, killing 100-200 million individuals overall, making it one of the worst human infectious diseases. Currently, plague epidemics still break out sporadically in various parts of the world, particularly in Madagascar and Africa. Approximately 2000 cases of plague are reported each year to the WHO.\n",
       "Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a family of rare, progressive, neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals. The term \"prions\" refers to abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are capable of inducing abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins called prion proteins, which are found most abundantly in the brain. TSEs are distinguished by long incubation periods, characteristic spongiform changes associated with neuronal loss and a failure to induce an inflammatory response. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a prion disease that was first described in 1996 in the UK. There is now strong scientific evidence that the agent responsible for the outbreak of prion disease in cows, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; or \"mad cow\" disease), is the same agent responsible for the outbreak of vCJD in humans. In June 2000, the European Union's (EU) BSE control measures were strengthened by requiring all Member States to remove specified risk materials from animal feed and human food chains. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, reindeer, sika deer and moose. It has been found in some areas of Canada, the USA, Norway and South Korea. To date, there is no strong evidence for any occurrence of CWD in humans. Scrapie is a TSE that affects sheep and goats. It has been known since 1732 and does not appear to be transmissible to humans. There are currently no cures for prion diseases. The unique resistance of prions to classic methods of decontamination and the evidence that prion diseases can be transmitted by medical devices pose a serious infection control challenge to healthcare facilities. 28 IV. DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL: LIVESTOCK prevent, control and even eradicate transmissible animal diseases have been developed under the auspices of the OIE and can be accessed online in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. 29 The general principles covering the measures described in this section are applicable to multiple diseases. 30 Importantly, it is emphasised that veterinary services should ensure that any prevention and control programme be proportionate with the risk, be practical and feasible within the national context and be based on a risk analysis.\n",
       "In livestock, the epidemiological unit is a group of animals (not individuals) exposed to the same risk. In the developed world, this usually comprises a farm or production unit (pig and poultry production units, feedlots), as well as live animal markets, exhibitions and trade fairs. Traded animals should also be quarantined before entering a new production unit. Livestock disease programmes are implemented in a given country or region (eg the EU) by the competent national authorities (veterinary services).\n",
       "Controlling a disease means implementing measures with a view to mitigating the burden of the disease by reducing its prevalence (ie the proportion of a disease that is present in a particular animal population at any given time). This is usually achieved by testing (a proportion) of animals for serological traces of an infection (antibody detection), compulsory vaccinations combined with animal movement restrictions and the implementation of a test-and-slaughter policy (ie the culling of all susceptible animals in highly infected production units). Progress in the programme is measured by the reduction of the incidence of the infection (ie the proportion of new infections in a given animal population at any given time). In essence, a control programme has to be continued indefinitely.\n",
       "Eradicating a disease means that the infectious agent has to be eliminated from a given animal population. Eradication can be envisaged when the prevalence has been reduced to a level close to 2% of production units. At that point in time, other measures have to come into force. They usually involve a prohibition of vaccination, testing and the implementation of a strict test-and-slaughter policy. This is very costly, but once eradication is achieved (a country is deemed \"free from the disease\"), there is no more disease burden, and post-eradication measures consist mainly in surveillance measures. In addition, live animals can only be traded internationally if they originate from a country that is free from the disease.\n",
       "Significantly, some livestock pathogens, such as ASF, survive for a long time in fresh or partially cooked meat or in milk (some pathogens are resistant to pasteurisation). They can also be spread by fomites (ie contaminated inanimate objects, such as clothing). Measures such as banning the importation of animal products are implemented to avoid the reintroduction of a pathogen into a naive population (ie a population in which \"herd immunity\" towards a given pathogen could not be established because it has been eliminated from the population).\n",
       "In 2011, the OIE declared rinderpest (caused by the rinderpest virus, a morbillivirus closely related to the measles and canine distemper viruses) to have been eradicated both from livestock and even-toed ungulate species such as cattle, buffalo, antelope and warthogs. This effort is considered to be one of veterinary medicine's greatest achievements. On another note, in 1980, the WHO confirmed the global eradication of smallpox (caused by the Variola major and Variola minor orthopoxviruses) amongst humans.\n",
       "The eradication of both diseases could not have been achieved worldwide without the extensive use of safe and efficient vaccines.\n",
       "Veterinary vaccines have had, and continue to have, a major role in protecting animal health and public health, reducing animal suffering, enabling the efficient production of food animals to feed the burgeoning human population and greatly reducing the need for antibiotics to treat food and companion animals. They ensure safe and efficient food production, the control of zoonotic diseases and the control of emerging and exotic diseases in animals and humans, as well as reducing the need for antibiotics. 31 An important concept in vaccination is that of \"herd immunity\". Herd immunity is the protection offered to a group of animals when a sufficiently high proportion of individual animals have been vaccinated. This reduces the numbers of susceptible individuals in an area, as well as the prevalence of disease. This concept is also important in human epidemiology. Unfortunate examples of what can happen when herd immunity diminishes have been the outbreaks of measles in the UK since 2017, which are thought to be due to reduced numbers of children being vaccinated, particularly in Roma communities. 32\n",
       "So far, no specific international instruments have been adopted with a view to preventing the spread of pandemics of animal origin. That said, the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) has enhanced the standards laid down by the OIE, which play a key role in preventing the dissemination of pathogens (Subsection 1). Accordingly, a health approach is intertwined with trade considerations. Secondly, more traditional nature conservation instruments can also contribute to reducing these risks (Subsection 2). The SPS Agreement elaborates specific rules \"for the application of Article XX(b)\" of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that allows national measures \"to protect human, animal and plant life or health\". 33 In particular, this agreement strikes a delicate balance between the right of the Members to adopt and to maintain measures \"necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health\" and the need to restrict the use of such measures for protectionist purposes. Given that SPS measures must necessarily achieve their goals, less trade-restrictive alternatives must be excluded (necessity test).\n",
       "In virtue of Article 2.2, Members have the right to enact SPS measures inasmuch as they are based upon \"scientific principles\" and are not maintained without \"sufficient scientific evidence\". Furthermore, pursuant to Article 2.3, SPS measures may not be chosen arbitrarily or give rise to \"unjustifiable restriction or disguised restriction on trade\".\n",
       "In accordance with Article 3.1, WTO Members shall base their sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations and may choose measures that \"conform to international standards\" (eg OIE). The SPS measures that conform to these international standards shall be deemed to be necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health and presumed to be consistent with the relevant provisions of this Agreement and of GATT 1994.\n",
       "Nonetheless, Article 3.3 allows WTO Members to introduce or maintain a distinctively higher level of protection than these international standards, ins far as their measures are:\n",
       "• Scientifically justified; or • Adopted \"as a consequence of the level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection a Member determines to be appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraphs 1 through 8 of Article 5\".\n",
       "Where there are no OIE recommendations or if the country chooses a level of protection requiring measures more stringent than the standards of the OIE, these should be based on an import risk analysis conducted in accordance with Chapter 2.1. Accordingly, the SPS Agreement enhances the role played by the guidelines of the OIE. The OIE has thus become the WTO reference organisation for standard setting for animal health and zoonotic diseases. Pursuant to 3(4) SPS, \"Members shall play a full part : : : in the relevant international organizations and their subsidiary bodies, in particular : : : the International Office of Epizootics\".\n",
       "Specific standards and recommendations (ie the Terrestrial Code) have been adopted by the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission (the Code Commission). This Commission draws on the expertise of internationally renowned specialists when adopting international standards. The OIE publishes two codes (Terrestrial and Aquatic) and two manuals (Terrestrial and Aquatic) as the principle reference for WTO members, 34 which form a key part of the WTO legal framework for 33 Preamble, last sentence. 34 <https://www.oie.int/en/international-standard-setting/overview>. international trade. WTO Members should thus align their import requirements with the recommendations contained in the relevant standards of the Terrestrial Code.\n",
       "In order to enable free access to world animal health data, the OIE provides Internet users with a variety of computer tools designed to fulfil specific user needs. This portal provides easy access to these tools in order to ensure more accurate results while searching for world animal health information.\n",
       "The World Animal Health Information System, better known as WAHIS, 35 is an Internet-based computer system that processes data on animal diseases in real time and then informs the international community. In addition, WAHIS-Wild is a system that gathers and presents information on wildlife diseases that are not included in the OIE list, but are considered to require surveillance. These diseases are not subject to compulsory notification, although Member Countries are encouraged to provide information concerning them voluntarily if they are of significant interest for knowledge in the area of animal health. 36\n",
       "In the aftermath of the lockdown of Hubei province, the Chinese Government imposed a total ban on the trade in and consumption of wild animals in order to reduce the risk of virus transfer from animals to human beings. The heart of the matter is thus whether the legal instruments intended to ensure biodiversity conservation are sufficient in addressing the threats stemming from the viruses harboured by wild animals. Although the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted how wild animals can act as a reservoir for hazardous pathogens, the CBD as well as other international nature conservation instruments are addressing wildlife diseases as a threat to biodiversity, not as reservoir of pathogens for livestock and humans. That said, recent research shows that the causes of wildlife population declines have also facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans. 37 In the following sections, we attempt to assess whether wildlife law and food safety law governing the trade in endangered species, bushmeat and trophies provide effective protection against the spread of pathogens.\n",
       "a. The regulation of the trade in endangered animal species Although the trade in wild animals dates back centuries, it has increased dramatically with the globalisation of the economy and the rise of wealthy consumers eager to acquire exotic wildlife products. As a result, the legal trade has become significant as well as very lucrative. The main problem is that much of the trade is unlawful. As it is highly lucrative, wildlife trafficking has become one of the world's most profitable organised crime offences and is ranked alongside human trafficking, arms trafficking and drug dealing in terms of profits. Its exact scale is difficult to quantify, although different sources estimate the profits from such trafficking to be between €8 and €20 billion annually. 38 Wildlife trafficking not only has a devastating impact on biodiversity, threatening to eradicate some species, but is also a vehicle for the spread of pathogens.\n",
       "On 3 March 1973, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was concluded in Washington, DC. The Convention has 183 parties, including the EU. 39 We shall briefly comment on the three-pronged approach endorsed by CITES. Trade in species \"threatened with extinction\" 40 that are listed in Appendix I is prohibited, with some exceptions. Conversely, trade in \"species which are not necessarily now threatened with extinction\" but \"may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival\" 41 is permitted inasmuch as it is subject to control. These species are listed in Appendix II, which also includes so-called \"lookalike species\" (ie species whose specimens in trade look like those of species listed for conservation reasons). 42 The exporting state must authorise the trade by the granting of an export permit based on proper documentation demonstrating the absence of risk. However, the importing states are not required to issue import permits. 43 Appendix III contains species that are protected in at least one country, which has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade.\n",
       "The Conference of the Parties is regularly adding to or removing species from Appendix I and II, or moved between them. 44 Europe is currently a destination market and a hub for trafficking in transit to other regions. 45 In order to achieve a high level of environmental protection, the EU has adopted stricter domestic measures than those provided for under CITES. For instance, the Basic Regulation's prohibition list contained in Annex A covers more species than CITES on the grounds that it encompasses some CITES Appendix II and III species. By the same token, Annex B, which regulates the trade in CITES Appendix II species, also encompasses some CITES Appendix III species.\n",
       "Although these two Regulations are directly applicable in all EU Member States, they only vaguely specify the enforcement provisions (investigation, prosecution, penalties, etc.). 48 As a result, Member States must provide for complementary provisions in order to ensure that breaches are punished in an appropriate manner. On 26 February 2016, the European Commission adopted the Communication on an EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking, 49 which sets out a comprehensive blueprint for joined-up efforts to fight wildlife crime inside the EU and for strengthening the EU's role in the global fight against these illegal activities.\n",
       "Many legal scholars consider CITES as \"one of the most effective regulatory schemes\" 50 or as \"the most successful of all international treaties concerned with the conservation of wildlife\". 51 That said, CITES does not appear to be an effective legal instrument for dealing with the health risks stemming from the trade in species. Indeed, the scope of CITES encompasses exclusively species that are threatened by international trade. Accordingly, the Convention does cover either species subject to internal trade or species threatened by habitat loss. Of particular salience in this respect is the number of mammal species, one of the reservoirs of pathogens, covered by CITES. Among the 6495 species of currently recognised mammals, 52 Appendix I lists 318 species, whilst Appendix II lists 513 species.\n",
       "In addition, CITES is poorly enforced in many countries. The pangolins are a case in point in this regard. There are eight species of pangolin, four of which occur in Asia and with four native to Africa. Pangolins are the world's most trafficked mammal, and an estimated 1 million pangolins have been poached during the past decade alone. Over recent decades, poachers have been decimating their populations in order to supply meat and scales to domestic and international markets in East and South-East Asia. 53 The meat is a delicacy, and different parts of the animals are used in traditional medicine such as aphrodisiacs. The consumption of pangolin meat and products enhances the social status of their consumers. Over the years, demand for pangolins has continued to grow sharply as the populations decline. With the depletion of Asian pangolin populations, the illicit trade has been progressively shifting to Africa. Today, this illegal trade thus involves all eight species. Given the sheer pressure of trade on their survival, pangolins have a long history in CITES. In 1975, several Asian species were already listed in Appendix II. 54 Other species were subsequently added to that Appendix. At the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (CoP17, Johannesburg, 2016), all eight species of pangolin were transferred from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I. This change resulted in a prohibition on trade in the eight species of pangolin. In spite of this regulatory improvement, the trade did not peter out. Recently, Vietnam was considered a major hub for pangolin trafficking into China. 55 The fate of the pangolins clearly illustrates that wildlife trafficking has received a low enforcement priority compared with other forms of trafficking. 56 Lately, the UN General Assembly has been encouraging the Member States to take decisive steps at the national level to prevent, combat and eradicate the illegal trade in wildlife, on both the supply and demand sides, including by strengthening the legislation necessary for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of such illegal trade, as well as by strengthening enforcement and criminal justice responses. 57 Along these lines, the fight against wildlife trafficking has also been proclaimed as one of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed upon by heads of state at a UN summit in September 2015. 58 In spite of these positive recent developments, the various regulations governing trading in wildlife appear to be insufficient to minimise the risks stemming from transmissible animal diseases, including zoonoses.\n",
       "Bushmeat is the everyday term for meat from wildlife species that are hunted for human consumption in Africa, Asia and Central or South America. Bushmeat can be smoked, dried or salted, although these processes do not render it non-infectious. Animal species hunted as bushmeat include primates, herbivores (duikers), rodents, reptiles (crocodiles), etc. A recent study in Nigeria showed that bushmeat consumption, especially of rodents, is uniquely related to improved food security. Reliance on a wider diversity of species in food-insecure households may in turn affect their nutrition and exposure to reservoirs of zoonotic infections, whilst also impacting on wildlife conservation. Alongside habitat destruction, bushmeat hunting is one of the major threats to wildlife conservation. \"While bushmeat hunting is predominantly a poor man's activity, eating wild meat is not\". 60 Bushmeat is not only extracted for personal consumption, but is also part of a lucrative organised trade, with high prices indicating luxury status. 61 Lately, many wilderness areas have been opened up to the markets thanks to improved access and faster transportation. Within many developing countries, this has led to a booming trade, which has exacerbated pressure on the hunted species. In effect, the expansion of illegal international trade is likely to heighten the over-exploitation of source populations, which have already been significantly depleted for domestic needs. Moreover, many primate species as well as all pangolin species are falling within the scope of the Appendix I CITES Convention. Other species, such as the blue duiker, are listed in Appendix II.\n",
       "Bushmeat can be a reservoir for zoonotic agents. In particular, primates pose a higher risk of transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans given their physiological similarities. 62 In Africa, human infections with Ebola have been associated with processing meat from infected primates.\n",
       "Given that illegal imports of meat can present substantial risks to public and animal health, concerns have been raised regarding the illegal import of bushmeat from developing countries into Europe, particularly in terms of the health risks posed to humans and livestock.\n",
       "Several European countries have reported considerable quantities of meat being imported on commercial passenger flights. In Switzerland, the total annual inflow of illegal meat imports per year was estimated at 1013 tonnes (95% confidence interval: 226-4192) for meat and 8.6 tonnes (95% confidence interval: 0.8-68.8) for bushmeat. 63 Between 3 and 20 June 2008, 29 Air France flights arriving at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport from Central and West Africa were checked between 05:00 and 11:00 hours, when most African flights land. Passengers carrying iceboxes were targeted for inspection. A total of 134 passengers arriving on 29 flights from 14 West and Central African countries were searched, and almost half of them were found to be carrying meat or fish. In total, it was estimated that 63.2 tonnes of meat and fish were imported per week on the Air France routes checked, of which 8% (5.25 tonnes) was bushmeat. Overall, 39% of the bushmeat carcasses were CITES-listed species (Appendix 1: trade banned; Appendix 2: trade restricted). 64 The import of uncertified meat is illegal or restricted for sanitary reasons. As far as the EU is concerned, the import of uncertified meat or of products from third countries continues to represent an \"unacceptable animal health risk\". 65 According to Commission Regulation (EC) No 745/2004, 66 all meat and meat products introduced into the EU by travellers are subject to veterinary checks in accordance with Directive 2002/99/EC. 67 They must be imported from countries from which exports of specified products of animal origin are permitted, 68 and they must be presented to a border inspection post accompanied by specific documentation. 69 However, it is difficult for customs authorities to detect the presence of this bushmeat, particularly when it is imported in small quantities. The lack of effective tools for detecting illegal meat imports is limiting the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts. To make matters worse, there is little research regarding the scale of this trade and the amount of bushmeat imported. Some studies have highlighted the emergence of a luxury market for African bushmeat in Europe. 70 c. The regulation of trophy hunting imports Recently, an article published in the prestigious journal Science claimed that trophy hunting bans imperil biodiversity. 71 This claim has generated considerable debate and controversy, ranging from assertions of inaccuracy to outrage. A consensus view is that trophy hunting is neither the main threat to nor the main opportunity for wildlife conservation, and that a broader debate should be encouraged. So far, trophy hunting has been regulated for the purpose of nature conservation and not for pathogen transmission to livestock and humans.\n",
       "Emerging infectious diseases are dominated by zoonoses originating mainly in wildlife. They represent a significant burden on global economies and public health, in particular when these diseases become pandemics. Their emergence is largely driven by socioeconomic, environmental and ecological factors. 72 If we are to make progress in conserving biodiversity and in preventing the emergence of diseases at the wildlife, livestock and human interface, of importance is to understand the role of pathogens in natural populations and, more importantly, how pathogens interact with other drivers of extinction to cause species loss and transmission of diseases.\n",
       "Currently, there is no vaccine against COVID-19. There is a hot debate on whether a sufficient number of people will have developed immunity after having been exposed naturally to SARS-CoV-2 in order to lead to herd immunity, so that some confinement measures can be lifted before a vaccine becomes available. Importantly, Dr Anthony Fauci stated on 24 April 2020: \"We really can't depend on herd immunity until we get either enough people infected, or enough people vaccinated\". 73 With the explosion of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world appears to have changed abruptly. There is a distinct before and after. Political responsibilities are having to be shouldered. Solidarity is rising up from the ashes. Businesses are adapting to the new constraints and suddenly discovering the virtues of a future circular economy. The financial sector is being forced to rethink its models. Will this unsettling strangeness end up plunging our contemporary societies into an unprecedented state of vulnerability? And could one say the same about climate change? Some might think that these questions will fade into the background once the pandemic has been brought under control and we all return to business as usual. But it is this in particular that we have to fear. Numerous scientists and researchers are cooperating on a massive scale at universities and research institutes around the world. This health crisis must make us stop and think about how we deal with risks, how we assess them and even how we talk about them. We need to move to a radically different social model for dealing with risk.\n",
       "Over the centuries, pandemics have laid down markers between different eras of human society. We must not wait for this new health crisis to be resolved before thinking about a radically new society. It has been suggested that we have entered the \"Anthropocene\", a new geological epoch dating from the start of significant human impacts on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change. 74 Worldwide, humankind is facing a new challenge: developing truly transdisciplinary research that encompasses all aspects of risk assessment, analysis and communication related to the prevention, surveillance and responses to emerging and re-emerging pathogens in a sustainable environment.\n",
       "We have written this article in an attempt to build bridges between disciplines and to raise awareness and mutual understanding concerning the challenges posed to society by emerging diseases.\n",
       "We must now define a new integrated understanding of the multilevel bio-social pathways that link up society, biology, health and socio-economic attainment in order to achieve the overarching objective of the UN Sustainable Development Goals: peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.

       "<br/> <strong>Title</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7248588/\" target=\"_blank\">The Story behind COVID-19: Animal Diseases at the Crossroads of Wildlife, Livestock and Human Health</a> <br/> <strong>Authors</strong>: DE SADELEER, Nicolas; GODFROID, Jacques<br/> <strong>Journal</strong>: nan<br/> <strong>Publish time</strong>: 2020-04-27<br/> <strong>Abstract</strong>: A number of virological, epidemiological and ethnographic arguments suggest that COVID-19 has a zoonotic origin. The pangolin, a species threatened with extinction due to poaching for both culinary purposes and traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, is now suspected of being the “missing link” in the transmission to humans of a virus that probably originated in a species of bat. Our predation of wild fauna and the reduction in their habitats have thus ended up creating new interfaces that favour the transmission of pathogens (mainly viruses) to humans. Domesticated animals and wild fauna thus constitute a reservoir for almost 80% of emerging human diseases (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola). These diseases are all zoonotic in origin. As if out of a Chinese fairy tale, the bat and the pangolin have taught us a lesson: within an increasingly interdependent world, environmental crises will become ever more intertwined with health crises. Questions relating to public health will no longer be confined to the secrecy of the physician’s consulting room or the sanitised environment of the hospital. They are now being played out in the arena of international trade, ports and airports and distribution networks. Simply put, all human activity creates new interfaces that facilitate the transmission of pathogens from an animal reservoir to humans. This pluri-disciplinary article highlights that environmental changes, such as the reduction in habitats for wild fauna and the intemperate trade in fauna, are the biggest causes of the emergence of new diseases. Against this background, it reviews the different measures taken to control, eradicate and prevent the emergence of animal diseases in a globalised world.<br/> <strong>Body text</strong>: Today, the world is facing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus. In February 2020 in China, an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% was estimated for COVID-19. Every day, we are watching in real time the evolution of the pandemic around the world. 1 In March 2020, the centre of the pandemic moved to Europe, then later shifting to the USA in April.\n",
       "Although about 1,320,000 animal species have been identified, scientists estimate the total number of species on earth at more than 10 million. In addition, biodiversity is not distributed evenly across the planet. Generally speaking, on the continents, it increases from the poles towards the equator, whilst in the oceans the increase is much less pronounced, and sometimes operates in reverse.\n",
       "Biodiversity is passing through a period of major crisis. In November 2017, 15,364 scientists from 184 countries signed a \"Warning to Humanity\" published in BioScience expressing their concerns about the future of wildlife. 3 The signatories of this manifesto stressed that humanity is on a collision course with the natural world as ecosystems are being pushed beyond their capacities to support the web of life on this planet. In their wake-up call, they warned us that we are unleashing the sixth mass extinction, 4 in which many forms of life are likely to disappear. With the rate of extinction running at more than 100,000 times the background rate, half of all the world's species could become extinct within a few decades if humanity is unable to endorse \"a more environmentally sustainable alternative to business as usual\". 5 The nature and magnitude of the threats are well known, and they include fragmentation and habitat loss, over-harvesting of fauna, trading in species, etc. Despite past warnings, threats to biodiversity have continued unabated, making it impossible to meet the target of halting biodiversity loss in accordance with the Aichi biodiversity targets set by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (hereafter CBD). 6 As discussed as above, many of these threats compound the spread of viruses among humans.\n",
       "The task of reducing these threats is daunting. Many of the conservation measures undertaken by State authorities have been carried out in accordance with the CBD. Under that Agreement, conservation and sustainable use are regarded as the cornerstones of biodiversity policy. 7 Although conservation is not defined in the CBD, its preamble states that \"the fundamental requirement for the conservation of biological diversity is the in-situ conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats and the maintenance and recovery of viable populations of species in their natural surroundings\". The CBD defines \"sustainable use\" as \"the use of components of biological diversity in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity, thereby maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of present and future generations\". 8 The rationale of the latter concept is that it is possible to use biodiversity in a manner in which ecological processes, species and genetic variability remain above the thresholds needed for long-term viability. 9 As the assessment of the status of biodiversity lies at the core of the CBD, it is important to determine whether biodiversity trends can differ and also what the causes are of these differences. It has recently been demonstrated that biodiversity may rise or fall depending on metrics or taxa. However, few monitoring programmes have the resources needed in order to measure changes to biodiversity components accurately in time and space. It must be considered that, unless greater resources are deployed, there is often a risk of incorrect diversity changes being extrapolated based on individual measurements, regions or emblematic taxonomic groups. 10 While wildlife diseases alone may currently threaten few species, pathogens may be a significant threat to already-endangered species. This would be the case when diseases interact with other drivers such as habitat loss, climate change, overexploitation, invasive species and environmental pollution. 11\n",
       "Founded in 1924, the World Organisation for Animal Health (hereafter OIE, for Office International des Epizooties) is the intergovernmental organisation responsible for improving animal health worldwide. 12 The goal of the founding parties was to put an end to the epidemic diseases (named epizootics) that were devastating their livestock. These objectives are still among the priority missions of the OIE, both for diseases that affect animals only and those also that are transmissible to humans (called zoonoses). For the latter type, collaboration agreements have been concluded with the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations (UN).\n",
       "The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) 13 of the UN is frequently involved in emergency responses triggered by severe animal (infectious) diseases, which have the ability to spread rapidly over large geographical areas (\"transboundary animal diseases\", or TADs) into previously unaffected countries or regions, or by natural and human-made disasters such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, etc. Activities such as early warning and surveillance of emerging diseases are carried out jointly with the OIE.\n",
       "The parties to these two international organisations are required to report \"important\" livestock diseases. However, diseases affecting wildlife that are likely to harbour zoonotic pathogens are reported on a voluntary basis. This entails a risk that some \"important\" diseases may not be duly reported to the two international organisations.\n",
       "In order to understand the control of animal diseases, we shall classify them below according to their respective epidemiology. Each epidemiological category will be illustrated with reference to specific cases. The aim of this section is to highlight that routes of transmission can involve different livestock (eg pigs) and different wildlife species (eg bats). In addition, transmission routes for the same virus are likely to differ over space and time. Accordingly, these transmission routes are fraught with uncertainty. As this article does not seek to be exhaustive, some diseases that have caught the public attention will be mentioned but not developed in detail.\n",
       "Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are designated as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) based on the molecular characteristics of the virus and the ability of the virus to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting. AIVs rarely infect humans, although outbreaks of some AIVs in poultry have been associated with illness and death in humans. 14 The most severe influenza pandemic, the so-called \"Spanish Flu\", was caused by an AIV and is estimated to have caused 20-50 million deaths in 1918-1919. 15 The first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century occurred in 2009-2010 and was also caused by an AIV. Swine influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease in pigs caused by AIVs that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs, but usually cause few deaths. Sporadic human infections with swine flu have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called \"variant viruses\". As pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses, they may potentially be infected with influenza viruses from different species (eg ducks and humans) at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. If this new virus causes illness in humans and can be transmitted easily from person to person, an influenza pandemic can occur. This is what most likely happened in North America when an AIV with swine, avian and human genes emerged in the spring of 2009. 16 Following this pandemic, the WHO International Health Regulations Review Committee declared in 2011 that \"the world is ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic or to any similarly global, sustained and threatening public-health emergency\". The WHO therefore implemented the \"Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework\", 17 a global approach to pandemic influenza preparedness and response.\n",
       "The AIV that caused the 2009-2010 pandemic is now a regular human flu virus and continues to circulate seasonally throughout the world. 14 \n",
       "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which is caused by a picornavirus, affects all clovenhoofed animals, both domesticated and wild. FMD is characterised by fever and blister-like sores on the tongue and lips, in the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves. FMD is a TAD that severely affects the production of livestock and disrupts regional and international trade in animals and animal products. A very severe outbreak of FMD occurred in the UK during 2001, costing in excess of £3 billion, with 6.5 million animals slaughtered during control efforts. The first farm to suffer an outbreak was a pig farm, although the source of the virus remains a mystery. 18 FMD is not zoonotic. forest trees during the El Niño-related drought and fires caused by people in Indonesia in 1997-1998 resulted in the migration of these forest fruit bats to pig farms. 21 In 2001, during NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh, it was shown that ingestion of date palm sap contaminated with saliva or excreta from infected fruit bats was the main spill-over route, with no involvement of pigs as intermediate hosts. During these outbreaks, person-to-person transmission occurred among persons in close contact, including healthcare workers. 22 There is currently no available vaccine.\n",
       "It is believed, but has not been demonstrated, that infection with the Ebola virus occurs initially through contact with an infected animal, such as fruit bats or via intermediate amplifying hosts, such as a non-human primate. 23 After that, the virus spreads from person to person. The largest Ebola outbreak in history was first reported in March 2014 and declared resolved by the WHO on 10 June 2016. In addition to the devastating effects (more than 11,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), the Ebola epidemic severely impacted healthcare services and caused setbacks in the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis, measles and malaria in these countries. 24 At that time, there was no vaccine available. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is currently grappling with the world's second largest Ebola epidemic, with more than 2200 deaths and 3400 confirmed infections since the outbreak was declared on 1 August 2018. Vaccination is being implemented to control the current epidemic in DRC.\n",
       "As far as COVID-19 is concerned, the pangolin, a species threatened with extinction due to poaching for both culinary purposes and traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, is now suspected of being the \"missing link\" in the transmission to humans of a virus that probably originated in a species of bat. 25 Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and more than 200,000 people have died in 210 countries and territories as of 29 April 2020.\n",
       "West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that causes West Nile fever. WNV is spread by the bite of a mosquito infected with the virus, and it quickly established itself in North America following its initial recognition in New York City in 1999. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds that are natural hosts. WNV has a broad host range (more than 30 mammalian host species). In contrast to the position with birds, it does not spread directly between people. Severe disease may occur in horses (up to 40% mortality). 26 A vaccine is available for horses. The plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis is infamous as the cause of the Black Death (1347-1353) and the later Second Pandemic (fourteenth to nineteenth centuries CE), when devastating epidemics occurred throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. It has recently been suggested that human ectoparasites, such as human fleas or body lice, were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death, challenging the assumption that plague was predominantly spread in Europe by rats. 27 Overall, Y. pestis caused three major pandemics, killing 100-200 million individuals overall, making it one of the worst human infectious diseases. Currently, plague epidemics still break out sporadically in various parts of the world, particularly in Madagascar and Africa. Approximately 2000 cases of plague are reported each year to the WHO.\n",
       "Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a family of rare, progressive, neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals. The term \"prions\" refers to abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are capable of inducing abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins called prion proteins, which are found most abundantly in the brain. TSEs are distinguished by long incubation periods, characteristic spongiform changes associated with neuronal loss and a failure to induce an inflammatory response. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a prion disease that was first described in 1996 in the UK. There is now strong scientific evidence that the agent responsible for the outbreak of prion disease in cows, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; or \"mad cow\" disease), is the same agent responsible for the outbreak of vCJD in humans. In June 2000, the European Union's (EU) BSE control measures were strengthened by requiring all Member States to remove specified risk materials from animal feed and human food chains. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, reindeer, sika deer and moose. It has been found in some areas of Canada, the USA, Norway and South Korea. To date, there is no strong evidence for any occurrence of CWD in humans. Scrapie is a TSE that affects sheep and goats. It has been known since 1732 and does not appear to be transmissible to humans. There are currently no cures for prion diseases. The unique resistance of prions to classic methods of decontamination and the evidence that prion diseases can be transmitted by medical devices pose a serious infection control challenge to healthcare facilities. 28 IV. DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL: LIVESTOCK prevent, control and even eradicate transmissible animal diseases have been developed under the auspices of the OIE and can be accessed online in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. 29 The general principles covering the measures described in this section are applicable to multiple diseases. 30 Importantly, it is emphasised that veterinary services should ensure that any prevention and control programme be proportionate with the risk, be practical and feasible within the national context and be based on a risk analysis.\n",
       "In livestock, the epidemiological unit is a group of animals (not individuals) exposed to the same risk. In the developed world, this usually comprises a farm or production unit (pig and poultry production units, feedlots), as well as live animal markets, exhibitions and trade fairs. Traded animals should also be quarantined before entering a new production unit. Livestock disease programmes are implemented in a given country or region (eg the EU) by the competent national authorities (veterinary services).\n",
       "Controlling a disease means implementing measures with a view to mitigating the burden of the disease by reducing its prevalence (ie the proportion of a disease that is present in a particular animal population at any given time). This is usually achieved by testing (a proportion) of animals for serological traces of an infection (antibody detection), compulsory vaccinations combined with animal movement restrictions and the implementation of a test-and-slaughter policy (ie the culling of all susceptible animals in highly infected production units). Progress in the programme is measured by the reduction of the incidence of the infection (ie the proportion of new infections in a given animal population at any given time). In essence, a control programme has to be continued indefinitely.\n",
       "Eradicating a disease means that the infectious agent has to be eliminated from a given animal population. Eradication can be envisaged when the prevalence has been reduced to a level close to 2% of production units. At that point in time, other measures have to come into force. They usually involve a prohibition of vaccination, testing and the implementation of a strict test-and-slaughter policy. This is very costly, but once eradication is achieved (a country is deemed \"free from the disease\"), there is no more disease burden, and post-eradication measures consist mainly in surveillance measures. In addition, live animals can only be traded internationally if they originate from a country that is free from the disease.\n",
       "Significantly, some livestock pathogens, such as ASF, survive for a long time in fresh or partially cooked meat or in milk (some pathogens are resistant to pasteurisation). They can also be spread by fomites (ie contaminated inanimate objects, such as clothing). Measures such as banning the importation of animal products are implemented to avoid the reintroduction of a pathogen into a naive population (ie a population in which \"herd immunity\" towards a given pathogen could not be established because it has been eliminated from the population).\n",
       "In 2011, the OIE declared rinderpest (caused by the rinderpest virus, a morbillivirus closely related to the measles and canine distemper viruses) to have been eradicated both from livestock and even-toed ungulate species such as cattle, buffalo, antelope and warthogs. This effort is considered to be one of veterinary medicine's greatest achievements. On another note, in 1980, the WHO confirmed the global eradication of smallpox (caused by the Variola major and Variola minor orthopoxviruses) amongst humans.\n",
       "The eradication of both diseases could not have been achieved worldwide without the extensive use of safe and efficient vaccines.\n",
       "Veterinary vaccines have had, and continue to have, a major role in protecting animal health and public health, reducing animal suffering, enabling the efficient production of food animals to feed the burgeoning human population and greatly reducing the need for antibiotics to treat food and companion animals. They ensure safe and efficient food production, the control of zoonotic diseases and the control of emerging and exotic diseases in animals and humans, as well as reducing the need for antibiotics. 31 An important concept in vaccination is that of \"herd immunity\". Herd immunity is the protection offered to a group of animals when a sufficiently high proportion of individual animals have been vaccinated. This reduces the numbers of susceptible individuals in an area, as well as the prevalence of disease. This concept is also important in human epidemiology. Unfortunate examples of what can happen when herd immunity diminishes have been the outbreaks of measles in the UK since 2017, which are thought to be due to reduced numbers of children being vaccinated, particularly in Roma communities. 32\n",
       "So far, no specific international instruments have been adopted with a view to preventing the spread of pandemics of animal origin. That said, the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) has enhanced the standards laid down by the OIE, which play a key role in preventing the dissemination of pathogens (Subsection 1). Accordingly, a health approach is intertwined with trade considerations. Secondly, more traditional nature conservation instruments can also contribute to reducing these risks (Subsection 2). The SPS Agreement elaborates specific rules \"for the application of Article XX(b)\" of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that allows national measures \"to protect human, animal and plant life or health\". 33 In particular, this agreement strikes a delicate balance between the right of the Members to adopt and to maintain measures \"necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health\" and the need to restrict the use of such measures for protectionist purposes. Given that SPS measures must necessarily achieve their goals, less trade-restrictive alternatives must be excluded (necessity test).\n",
       "In virtue of Article 2.2, Members have the right to enact SPS measures inasmuch as they are based upon \"scientific principles\" and are not maintained without \"sufficient scientific evidence\". Furthermore, pursuant to Article 2.3, SPS measures may not be chosen arbitrarily or give rise to \"unjustifiable restriction or disguised restriction on trade\".\n",
       "In accordance with Article 3.1, WTO Members shall base their sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations and may choose measures that \"conform to international standards\" (eg OIE). The SPS measures that conform to these international standards shall be deemed to be necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health and presumed to be consistent with the relevant provisions of this Agreement and of GATT 1994.\n",
       "Nonetheless, Article 3.3 allows WTO Members to introduce or maintain a distinctively higher level of protection than these international standards, ins far as their measures are:\n",
       "• Scientifically justified; or • Adopted \"as a consequence of the level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection a Member determines to be appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraphs 1 through 8 of Article 5\".\n",
       "Where there are no OIE recommendations or if the country chooses a level of protection requiring measures more stringent than the standards of the OIE, these should be based on an import risk analysis conducted in accordance with Chapter 2.1. Accordingly, the SPS Agreement enhances the role played by the guidelines of the OIE. The OIE has thus become the WTO reference organisation for standard setting for animal health and zoonotic diseases. Pursuant to 3(4) SPS, \"Members shall play a full part : : : in the relevant international organizations and their subsidiary bodies, in particular : : : the International Office of Epizootics\".\n",
       "Specific standards and recommendations (ie the Terrestrial Code) have been adopted by the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission (the Code Commission). This Commission draws on the expertise of internationally renowned specialists when adopting international standards. The OIE publishes two codes (Terrestrial and Aquatic) and two manuals (Terrestrial and Aquatic) as the principle reference for WTO members, 34 which form a key part of the WTO legal framework for 33 Preamble, last sentence. 34 <https://www.oie.int/en/international-standard-setting/overview>. international trade. WTO Members should thus align their import requirements with the recommendations contained in the relevant standards of the Terrestrial Code.\n",
       "In order to enable free access to world animal health data, the OIE provides Internet users with a variety of computer tools designed to fulfil specific user needs. This portal provides easy access to these tools in order to ensure more accurate results while searching for world animal health information.\n",
       "The World Animal Health Information System, better known as WAHIS, 35 is an Internet-based computer system that processes data on animal diseases in real time and then informs the international community. In addition, WAHIS-Wild is a system that gathers and presents information on wildlife diseases that are not included in the OIE list, but are considered to require surveillance. These diseases are not subject to compulsory notification, although Member Countries are encouraged to provide information concerning them voluntarily if they are of significant interest for knowledge in the area of animal health. 36\n",
       "In the aftermath of the lockdown of Hubei province, the Chinese Government imposed a total ban on the trade in and consumption of wild animals in order to reduce the risk of virus transfer from animals to human beings. The heart of the matter is thus whether the legal instruments intended to ensure biodiversity conservation are sufficient in addressing the threats stemming from the viruses harboured by wild animals. Although the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted how wild animals can act as a reservoir for hazardous pathogens, the CBD as well as other international nature conservation instruments are addressing wildlife diseases as a threat to biodiversity, not as reservoir of pathogens for livestock and humans. That said, recent research shows that the causes of wildlife population declines have also facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans. 37 In the following sections, we attempt to assess whether wildlife law and food safety law governing the trade in endangered species, bushmeat and trophies provide effective protection against the spread of pathogens.\n",
       "a. The regulation of the trade in endangered animal species Although the trade in wild animals dates back centuries, it has increased dramatically with the globalisation of the economy and the rise of wealthy consumers eager to acquire exotic wildlife products. As a result, the legal trade has become significant as well as very lucrative. The main problem is that much of the trade is unlawful. As it is highly lucrative, wildlife trafficking has become one of the world's most profitable organised crime offences and is ranked alongside human trafficking, arms trafficking and drug dealing in terms of profits. Its exact scale is difficult to quantify, although different sources estimate the profits from such trafficking to be between €8 and €20 billion annually. 38 Wildlife trafficking not only has a devastating impact on biodiversity, threatening to eradicate some species, but is also a vehicle for the spread of pathogens.\n",
       "On 3 March 1973, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was concluded in Washington, DC. The Convention has 183 parties, including the EU. 39 We shall briefly comment on the three-pronged approach endorsed by CITES. Trade in species \"threatened with extinction\" 40 that are listed in Appendix I is prohibited, with some exceptions. Conversely, trade in \"species which are not necessarily now threatened with extinction\" but \"may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival\" 41 is permitted inasmuch as it is subject to control. These species are listed in Appendix II, which also includes so-called \"lookalike species\" (ie species whose specimens in trade look like those of species listed for conservation reasons). 42 The exporting state must authorise the trade by the granting of an export permit based on proper documentation demonstrating the absence of risk. However, the importing states are not required to issue import permits. 43 Appendix III contains species that are protected in at least one country, which has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade.\n",
       "The Conference of the Parties is regularly adding to or removing species from Appendix I and II, or moved between them. 44 Europe is currently a destination market and a hub for trafficking in transit to other regions. 45 In order to achieve a high level of environmental protection, the EU has adopted stricter domestic measures than those provided for under CITES. For instance, the Basic Regulation's prohibition list contained in Annex A covers more species than CITES on the grounds that it encompasses some CITES Appendix II and III species. By the same token, Annex B, which regulates the trade in CITES Appendix II species, also encompasses some CITES Appendix III species.\n",
       "Although these two Regulations are directly applicable in all EU Member States, they only vaguely specify the enforcement provisions (investigation, prosecution, penalties, etc.). 48 As a result, Member States must provide for complementary provisions in order to ensure that breaches are punished in an appropriate manner. On 26 February 2016, the European Commission adopted the Communication on an EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking, 49 which sets out a comprehensive blueprint for joined-up efforts to fight wildlife crime inside the EU and for strengthening the EU's role in the global fight against these illegal activities.\n",
       "Many legal scholars consider CITES as \"one of the most effective regulatory schemes\" 50 or as \"the most successful of all international treaties concerned with the conservation of wildlife\". 51 That said, CITES does not appear to be an effective legal instrument for dealing with the health risks stemming from the trade in species. Indeed, the scope of CITES encompasses exclusively species that are threatened by international trade. Accordingly, the Convention does cover either species subject to internal trade or species threatened by habitat loss. Of particular salience in this respect is the number of mammal species, one of the reservoirs of pathogens, covered by CITES. Among the 6495 species of currently recognised mammals, 52 Appendix I lists 318 species, whilst Appendix II lists 513 species.\n",
       "In addition, CITES is poorly enforced in many countries. The pangolins are a case in point in this regard. There are eight species of pangolin, four of which occur in Asia and with four native to Africa. Pangolins are the world's most trafficked mammal, and an estimated 1 million pangolins have been poached during the past decade alone. Over recent decades, poachers have been decimating their populations in order to supply meat and scales to domestic and international markets in East and South-East Asia. 53 The meat is a delicacy, and different parts of the animals are used in traditional medicine such as aphrodisiacs. The consumption of pangolin meat and products enhances the social status of their consumers. Over the years, demand for pangolins has continued to grow sharply as the populations decline. With the depletion of Asian pangolin populations, the illicit trade has been progressively shifting to Africa. Today, this illegal trade thus involves all eight species. Given the sheer pressure of trade on their survival, pangolins have a long history in CITES. In 1975, several Asian species were already listed in Appendix II. 54 Other species were subsequently added to that Appendix. At the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (CoP17, Johannesburg, 2016), all eight species of pangolin were transferred from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I. This change resulted in a prohibition on trade in the eight species of pangolin. In spite of this regulatory improvement, the trade did not peter out. Recently, Vietnam was considered a major hub for pangolin trafficking into China. 55 The fate of the pangolins clearly illustrates that wildlife trafficking has received a low enforcement priority compared with other forms of trafficking. 56 Lately, the UN General Assembly has been encouraging the Member States to take decisive steps at the national level to prevent, combat and eradicate the illegal trade in wildlife, on both the supply and demand sides, including by strengthening the legislation necessary for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of such illegal trade, as well as by strengthening enforcement and criminal justice responses. 57 Along these lines, the fight against wildlife trafficking has also been proclaimed as one of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed upon by heads of state at a UN summit in September 2015. 58 In spite of these positive recent developments, the various regulations governing trading in wildlife appear to be insufficient to minimise the risks stemming from transmissible animal diseases, including zoonoses.\n",
       "Bushmeat is the everyday term for meat from wildlife species that are hunted for human consumption in Africa, Asia and Central or South America. Bushmeat can be smoked, dried or salted, although these processes do not render it non-infectious. Animal species hunted as bushmeat include primates, herbivores (duikers), rodents, reptiles (crocodiles), etc. A recent study in Nigeria showed that bushmeat consumption, especially of rodents, is uniquely related to improved food security. Reliance on a wider diversity of species in food-insecure households may in turn affect their nutrition and exposure to reservoirs of zoonotic infections, whilst also impacting on wildlife conservation. Alongside habitat destruction, bushmeat hunting is one of the major threats to wildlife conservation. \"While bushmeat hunting is predominantly a poor man's activity, eating wild meat is not\". 60 Bushmeat is not only extracted for personal consumption, but is also part of a lucrative organised trade, with high prices indicating luxury status. 61 Lately, many wilderness areas have been opened up to the markets thanks to improved access and faster transportation. Within many developing countries, this has led to a booming trade, which has exacerbated pressure on the hunted species. In effect, the expansion of illegal international trade is likely to heighten the over-exploitation of source populations, which have already been significantly depleted for domestic needs. Moreover, many primate species as well as all pangolin species are falling within the scope of the Appendix I CITES Convention. Other species, such as the blue duiker, are listed in Appendix II.\n",
       "Bushmeat can be a reservoir for zoonotic agents. In particular, primates pose a higher risk of transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans given their physiological similarities. 62 In Africa, human infections with Ebola have been associated with processing meat from infected primates.\n",
       "Given that illegal imports of meat can present substantial risks to public and animal health, concerns have been raised regarding the illegal import of bushmeat from developing countries into Europe, particularly in terms of the health risks posed to humans and livestock.\n",
       "Several European countries have reported considerable quantities of meat being imported on commercial passenger flights. In Switzerland, the total annual inflow of illegal meat imports per year was estimated at 1013 tonnes (95% confidence interval: 226-4192) for meat and 8.6 tonnes (95% confidence interval: 0.8-68.8) for bushmeat. 63 Between 3 and 20 June 2008, 29 Air France flights arriving at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport from Central and West Africa were checked between 05:00 and 11:00 hours, when most African flights land. Passengers carrying iceboxes were targeted for inspection. A total of 134 passengers arriving on 29 flights from 14 West and Central African countries were searched, and almost half of them were found to be carrying meat or fish. In total, it was estimated that 63.2 tonnes of meat and fish were imported per week on the Air France routes checked, of which 8% (5.25 tonnes) was bushmeat. Overall, 39% of the bushmeat carcasses were CITES-listed species (Appendix 1: trade banned; Appendix 2: trade restricted). 64 The import of uncertified meat is illegal or restricted for sanitary reasons. As far as the EU is concerned, the import of uncertified meat or of products from third countries continues to represent an \"unacceptable animal health risk\". 65 According to Commission Regulation (EC) No 745/2004, 66 all meat and meat products introduced into the EU by travellers are subject to veterinary checks in accordance with Directive 2002/99/EC. 67 They must be imported from countries from which exports of specified products of animal origin are permitted, 68 and they must be presented to a border inspection post accompanied by specific documentation. 69 However, it is difficult for customs authorities to detect the presence of this bushmeat, particularly when it is imported in small quantities. The lack of effective tools for detecting illegal meat imports is limiting the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts. To make matters worse, there is little research regarding the scale of this trade and the amount of bushmeat imported. Some studies have highlighted the emergence of a luxury market for African bushmeat in Europe. 70 c. The regulation of trophy hunting imports Recently, an article published in the prestigious journal Science claimed that trophy hunting bans imperil biodiversity. 71 This claim has generated considerable debate and controversy, ranging from assertions of inaccuracy to outrage. A consensus view is that trophy hunting is neither the main threat to nor the main opportunity for wildlife conservation, and that a broader debate should be encouraged. So far, trophy hunting has been regulated for the purpose of nature conservation and not for pathogen transmission to livestock and humans.\n",
       "Emerging infectious diseases are dominated by zoonoses originating mainly in wildlife. They represent a significant burden on global economies and public health, in particular when these diseases become pandemics. Their emergence is largely driven by socioeconomic, environmental and ecological factors. 72 If we are to make progress in conserving biodiversity and in preventing the emergence of diseases at the wildlife, livestock and human interface, of importance is to understand the role of pathogens in natural populations and, more importantly, how pathogens interact with other drivers of extinction to cause species loss and transmission of diseases.\n",
       "Currently, there is no vaccine against COVID-19. There is a hot debate on whether a sufficient number of people will have developed immunity after having been exposed naturally to SARS-CoV-2 in order to lead to herd immunity, so that some confinement measures can be lifted before a vaccine becomes available. Importantly, Dr Anthony Fauci stated on 24 April 2020: \"We really can't depend on herd immunity until we get either enough people infected, or enough people vaccinated\". 73 With the explosion of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world appears to have changed abruptly. There is a distinct before and after. Political responsibilities are having to be shouldered. Solidarity is rising up from the ashes. Businesses are adapting to the new constraints and suddenly discovering the virtues of a future circular economy. The financial sector is being forced to rethink its models. Will this unsettling strangeness end up plunging our contemporary societies into an unprecedented state of vulnerability? And could one say the same about climate change? Some might think that these questions will fade into the background once the pandemic has been brought under control and we all return to business as usual. But it is this in particular that we have to fear. Numerous scientists and researchers are cooperating on a massive scale at universities and research institutes around the world. This health crisis must make us stop and think about how we deal with risks, how we assess them and even how we talk about them. We need to move to a radically different social model for dealing with risk.\n",
       "Over the centuries, pandemics have laid down markers between different eras of human society. We must not wait for this new health crisis to be resolved before thinking about a radically new society. It has been suggested that we have entered the \"Anthropocene\", a new geological epoch dating from the start of significant human impacts on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change. 74 Worldwide, humankind is facing a new challenge: developing truly transdisciplinary research that encompasses all aspects of risk assessment, analysis and communication related to the prevention, surveillance and responses to emerging and re-emerging pathogens in a sustainable environment.\n",
       "We have written this article in an attempt to build bridges between disciplines and to raise awareness and mutual understanding concerning the challenges posed to society by emerging diseases.\n",
       "We must now define a new integrated understanding of the multilevel bio-social pathways that link up society, biology, health and socio-economic attainment in order to achieve the overarching objective of the UN Sustainable Development Goals: peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.

Framed by sociotechnical transitions theory, we introduce the concept of ‘shadowcasting’ to show how tourism knowledge disseminated through the media, combined with public comments on its reporting, cast shadows that co-constitute imagined futures. We illustrate shadowcasting through a mixed method approach that demonstrates how media reporting and public comments on a recent paper on autonomous vehicles in tourism emerged and diverged from the original paper. Our findings reveal that issues around sex and terrorism were sensationalised, generating diverse public discourses that challenge linear visions of future transport efficiency. Our concluding discussion indicates other tourism research contexts that are most inclined to shadowcasting.<br/> <strong>Body text</strong>: It is now widely accepted that tourism is a field of study as opposed to a discipline (c.f. Tribe, 1997). In contrast to disciplines that describe a particular method of enquiry, fields concentrate on specific phenomena or an area of interest. The activity of tourism is at the heart of global mobility, interconnected with other mobility flows and interdependencies within processes of globalisation. Tourism is paradoxically a soothing funnel for aspirations and identities in late-modern capitalist life (Gössling et al., 2018), while also producing anxieties and insecurities attached to its potential disruption, such as tourism's vulnerability to terrorism, its contribution to climate change, or its recent suspension due to Covid-19 lockdowns. It is this status as a field of high centrality to late-modern life that can make studies of tourism, particularly ones which expose this paradox and thereby threaten societal perceptions of tourism as a panacea for social ills, prone to media attention, hype and sensationalisation.\n",
       "Tourism knowledge is predominantly viewed as an attempt ‘to capture, to represent, to describe, and to explain the phenomenon of tourism’ (Tribe, 1997: 642). Yet, Tribe (ibid) also ascribes agency to tourism knowledge, albeit limited to its ability to solve business problems. We argue in this paper that this performative aspect of tourism knowledge extends beyond business interests to play a wider role in co-constructing social realities. Especially in cases where the media reports on tourism research, and publics contribute to the shaping of discourse through related online comments and social media, tourism knowledge has the potential to cast shadows across public space that contribute to processes of imagining possible tourism futures. The present paper is centrally concerned with these under-theorised shadows. We therefore introduce the concept of ‘shadowcasting’ to show how tourism research, associated media reporting and public reactions to it are bound up in future-making, and use a recent paper on autonomous vehicles in tourism as empirical evidence to illustrate our argument.\n",
       "Autonomous vehicles have received significant attention across academic, industry and media reporting. Initially, this work focused on technical capabilities, developing a consistent message and the construction of largely positive discourse. Over time, however, this morphed to examine the implications of autonomous vehicle development, and emergence, on different systems, industries and sectors. A paper in this journal by Cohen and Hopkins (2019) (https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/autonomous-vehicles-could-shape-future-urban-tourism) – Autonomous vehicles and the future of urban tourism – provided the first examination of how autonomous vehicles might impact upon tourism. Their work pointed to the enchantments and apprehensions of autonomous vehicles at different scales, questioning how they might affect tourist experiences, use of different transport modes, tourist-host interactions, and tourism employment, as well as considerations of potential spatial changes and implications for the night-time economy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Cohen and Hopkins' (2019) (https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/autonomous-vehicles-could-shape-future-urban-tourism) paper was press released by the University of Surrey (UK) External Communications and Public Relations team upon its publication in November 2018. This press release led to the paper's quick sensationalisation in the global mass media, resulting in 77 English language media headlines alone, ranging from The Washington Post and The Telegraph to The Daily Beast, BroBible and The Inquirer. Coverage by the various media grew when one the paper's more tentative suggestions, that autonomous vehicles may lead to more (commercial) sex in cars, got comically riffed on the American television talk-show The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (13/11/2018).\n",
       "In this paper, our aim is to provide a detailed analysis of the media reporting and public comments on this reporting associated with the Cohen and Hopkins (2019) (https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/autonomous-vehicles-could-shape-future-urban-tourism) paper, and track a genealogy of its emergence, dominant discourses and potential implications. In doing so we shed light on the interface of tourism research and its dissemination within the media, an area of study neglected to date in tourism scholarship. In contrast to our focus on the scholarly communication of tourism research within the media and the shadows this casts on the objects of our research, research on the role of the media in relation to tourism has instead largely centred on the implications of media reporting for destination image and how the tourism sector is represented and framed (e.g. McLennan et al., 2017; Walters et al., 2016). Such media analyses appropriately employ concepts such as agenda-setting, framing, priming and media sensationalism as theoretical underpinnings. These concepts, which are often subsumed under the umbrella of agenda-setting theory (Scheufele, 2000), have resonance for the present paper, however it is not our intention here to re-rehearse this theoretical framing, which is long-established and a common vantage point in communication and journalism studies (McCombs et al., 2014).\n",
       "Instead, we situate our empirical analysis within scholarship on sociotechnical transitions, which provides an alternative lens for understanding how sociotechnical innovation and hype in particular is expressed through media reporting. This provides a basis for considering how research, media reporting and public reactions to it are bound up in future-making, a post-structuralist methodological innovation which we conceptualise and differentiate in this article as ‘shadowcasting’. To achieve our aim, we use a mixed method approach of quantitative text and sentiment analysis combined with qualitative thematic analysis of media reports and public comments on these reports.\n",
       "Sociotechnical transitions scholarship provides conceptual tools for examining the emergence and diffusion of innovations – including autonomous vehicles (e.g. Hopkins and Schwanen, 2018, Hopkins and Schwanen, 2019), and illustrates the different roles media actors (along with a diversity of other actor groups) have in this process. The Multi-Level Perspective (Geels, 2002) represents a mid-level theory within sustainability transitions research, combining concepts from evolutionary economics, science and technology studies, structuration theory and neoinstitutional theory (Geels, 2011). It is concerned with sociotechnical systems, and the inextricability of the social and societal from the technical. Specifically, the Multi-Level Perspective focuses on the interactions between three analytical levels – niches, regimes and landscapes – which differ in levels of structuration but which are co-constituted and influence the emergence and potential uptake of novel innovations (Geels, 2012; Köhler et al., 2019). Theorisation of processes occurring at the niche level of innovation focus on degrees of protection (i.e. from the dominant regime), different types of uncertainties (e.g. techno-economic, finance and investment, cognitive, social), and the development of alliances (Geels et al., 2018). The construction of hype, positive discourse(s) and sociotechnical expectations is often articulated as a central feature of sociotechnical niche development as a way to overcome various uncertainties (Van Lente et al., 2013) and to allow niches to grow and stabilise.\n",
       "Multi-scalar media institutions operate largely within the sociotechnical landscape, along with, for instance, political ideologies, social values and macro-economic trends (Geels, 2012), however heterogeneous media actors also play important roles in the growth of niche innovations, and the stabilisation of regimes. Not all media are equal, of course; the reach of different forms of media varies, especially as media ownership has become increasingly compressed to fewer organisations. As part of the sociotechnical landscape, different types of media bear influence on the dynamics of niche development and regime in/stability. Yet the media also has a role to play from within and across niches and regimes. Both regime and niche actors may ‘play the media’ as one approach (often coupled with others) to instigate change or ensure stability of the dominant regime (Duineveld et al., 2009). But the media also acts to forward its own interests, with media outlets aligned to particular partisan positionings, and a range of new media (e.g. BuzzFeed) challenge traditional outlets. Sensationalism is often associated with media discourse (e.g. Ge, 2016), and scientists and reporters can be complicit in the construction of sensational headlines (Ransohoff & Ransohoff, 2001). There are extensive literatures pointing to the largely problematic use of sex in advertising, marketing and by the mass media. The latter has reflected heightened media attention paid to gendered representation of sexual relationships, sexual mis/conduct and sex work (Hill & Thomson, 2000). McRobbie (2008) talks of a ‘sexualized media’ with a ‘sexualization of popular culture’ (Gill, 2006) used to heighten public awareness and/or attention to particular issues. If ‘sex sells’, then it can also be used (and abused) to increase focus on particular issues and innovations.\n",
       "The hype-disappointment cycle differs from traditional producer or outcome/object-oriented approaches in that it focuses on communities of (potential) users and technology adopters, and the performativity of purposeful constructions of hype as part of the innovation cycle by various actors. Media reporting is often used as one way to measure innovation hype. For example, Melton et al. (2016) use New York Times coverage of alternative vehicle fuels as a proxy for societal attention, and associate waves of media attention with changing sociotechnical expectations, characterised by multiple waves of hype and disappointment. Disappointment occurs when public experiences of the innovation do not live up to the promises put forward by innovators and other associated actor groups. This results in complex dynamics whereby innovation actors seek to build excitement while also anchoring expectations to everyday norms and practices, and shifting discourse through the innovation process. Thus, across time, the way niche and regime actors interact with the media will (be) change(d). Where exactly autonomous vehicles appear on the hype cycle is unclear (see, Gartner hype cycle for emerging technologies (2019)), not least due to their different applications (e.g. for freight or passenger transport), and various levels of automation and spaces of implementation (e.g. motorways versus inner-city). It can be reasonably assumed, however, that recent collisions and fatalities associated with automated features have contributed to increased negative media reporting potentially leading to post-peak hype (Gartner, 2019).\n",
       "Sensationalising innovations to gain media attention is not uncommon. Nor is media sensationalisation to attract readers. This is important as media reporting plays a significant role in generating interest and shaping attitudes towards science (Castell et al., 2015). Additionally, how research is communicated to media outlets is also significant, and this process is often at least partly out of the hands of university researchers, and instead led by a communications unit within the university. In such cases, a level of interpretation occurs, where the media outlets may be responding to the press release, rather than the paper-as-a-whole. Researchers may be understandably displeased, or indeed angered, at misleading claims that can create public confusion and mistrust in research (Yavchitz et al., 2012). Following Jóhannesson et al. (2015), we nevertheless argue that times of controversy may represent the best available occasion to observe and/or potentially contribute to the (re)making of tourism. This is because controversy – like crisis and breakdown - brings to the surface the plurality of social relations, encounters and entanglements emerging within highly situated and relational contexts. This has been shown by Star (1999) and others with relation to infrastructures, which are, by their very nature, rendered invisible, yet become highly visible when something goes – or is made - wrong. Thus, it may be suggested that the selective interpretation and sensationalisation of specific imagined possibilities for autonomous vehicles within the Cohen and Hopkins (2019) (https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/autonomous-vehicles-could-shape-future-urban-tourism) article and across diverse media, and the availability of big data to track reactions, offers a unique opportunity to observe the formation of certain practices, attitudes and perceptions emerging alongside and as part of autonomous vehicle innovation.\n",
       "We position the role of media in this context as a co-constitutive element of the sociotechnical transition towards automation, involving a range of actor groups, including, but not limited to, innovators, policymakers, researchers, various publics and university communications teams. With an understanding that the media often makes attention-getting claims when reporting scientific results (Adams et al., 2019), we examine the responses to the article by Cohen and Hopkins (2019) (https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/autonomous-vehicles-could-shape-future-urban-tourism) but do so with a methodological orientation which we conceive and delineate as ‘shadowcasting’.\n",
       "We define shadowcasting as a methodological orientation aimed at understanding how academic research, its dissemination through the media, and public comments on that media reporting, co-constitute an imagined politics of the future that informs anticipatory action and forms of governance in the present. In this sense, academic research contributes to shadows that are cast across contingent and often contested spheres, whereby research takes on a further agency that co-produces social realities. When shadows are cast they create a presence for the objects they encounter as well as altering our perception of the objects they contact. Presence, in this context, is understood as performances of the disseminated research that ‘enact’ the speculations they describe (Lash & Urry, 1993). While these enactments may not necessarily lead directly to prescriptions for action they can take on an important role in defining and framing future research and the kinds of interventions that are deemed possible (Shove et al., 2012).\n",
       "Shadowcasting appreciates that shared public speculation about futures may culminate in different understandings. Cohen et al. (2018) for instance analysed comments made by the public towards media reporting on a study on business travel and found that the research had contributed to the creation of differing public discourses. This suggests that the representation of academic research in the media has the potential to influence sociotechnical systems, including the innovation process. It might do this by offering critical lenses to much-hyped phenomena. While there is a long history of methodological approaches that blur the line between science and media reporting, including research dissemination (Brown, 2012), there is little understanding of how the reporting of academic research affects imaginations of the future and what kind of pathways to impact this may create.\n",
       "We argue that media reporting and public reactions to it opens a space for inquiry within the growing field of the social science of future-making (Anderson & Adey, 2012; Salazar et al., 2017; Urry, 2016). The social science of future-making is a post-structuralist body of research which argues that the increasing possibilities for re-making everyday life, in part resulting from global mobilities and threats (e.g. climate change, pandemics, terrorism, financial instability), has exposed the social sciences' somewhat inflexible orientation to the re-productive relationship between the past and the present.\n",
       "In this light, we argue that media agenda-setting theory can be viewed as a structuralist approach (Adams et al., 2014 refer to it as an ‘objective theory’), which may not fully elucidate the relational dynamics of research, the media and publics within sociotechnical transitions. Agenda-setting theory argues for a ‘cause-and-effect relationship between the power of the press and the public opinion’ (cf. Adams et al., 2014: 2). Such an approach, for example, might situate media reporting as a sub-genre within a stable sociotechnical system, contributing to the progression of linear stages moving from a less efficient to a more efficient and finished innovation. This could diminish the active role publics, and other actors, play in sociotechnical transitions and overlook the wider contexts in which innovations and media are attributed and attributing meaning.\n",
       "Shadowcasting's closest foundation in studies of media effects seems to lie within McQuail's (2005) notion of a ‘constructed reality’ paradigm in communications studies, whereby mass media may have ‘strong effects on attitudes and information processing but that these effects’ are ‘contingent on individual level characteristics’ (Cacciatore et al., 2016:18). Yet agenda-setting is still largely characterised by predictive power and linearity, wherein the ‘media transfers [issue] salience to audiences’ (ibid: 11). In contrast to this, and other approaches often used in tourism research such as forecasting (Song & Li, 2008) and backcasting (Ceron & Dubois, 2007), shadowcasting is a critical, post-structuralist approach with its emphasis on how a range of actor groups co-constitute future imaginaries.\n",
       "We therefore build on Pink et al. (2018) who have also argued in the case of autonomous vehicles that they are emerging from the processual opening-up of possibilities across a range of transport and media systems in the present, which constitute the future as contingent. This approach shifts focus away from deterministic hype, linear stages and passive users, towards how publics create diverse futures by negotiating the possibilities of the present. We thus draw from Anderson and Adey (2012) who argue not for researching the future as an object, but instead to examine how current social relations are constituted by the way in which the future is brought into the present and takes on imagined and affective presence.\n",
       "Shadowcasting therefore offers tools to analyse media hype on potential futures, including the politics and power relations of sociotechnical transition in the present. For instance, the approach to regime governance of autonomous vehicles thus far often espouses automation as progress, promising to bring a new and better future. Adam and Groves (2007) have argued that discourses on progress have relied heavily on understanding the future as open and indeterminate, which has in turn afforded commodified futures. Depicting the future as open often follows processes of de-contextualising and emptying the future of meaning in order to create a blank slate from which to create rational plans free of obstacles. To date, governance of autonomous vehicles has focused on overcoming a series of technological challenges and safety issues that increases the market potential by improving the efficiency of transport systems (Bissell et al., 2020). The need for efficiency is constructed not in relation to ‘citizens’, for instance, but ‘abstract users’ in need of education (Stilgoe, 2018) – this ignores the diverse range of intersecting practices and contexts that may be emotionally rewarding for publics and render efficiency undesirable (Urry, 2016).\n",
       "Therefore, constructing autonomous vehicles in relation to the future as open contributes to what scholars have described as a prioritisation of expert visions about possible futures (Hopkins & Schwanen, 2018) while diminishing a need to anticipate a wider range of alternative futures through public engagement. Thus, by including public reactions to the media, shadowcasting helps to not only capture and elevate public imaginations of the future but also aides in contrasting diverse sets of relations between the present and future that underpin sociotechnical transitions.\n",
       "A quantitative analysis of the text-based data was conducted using several open-source natural language processing tools. First, KH-Coder (Angus, 2016) was used for content analysis of the unstructured text and to detect potential themes in both the media coverage and subsequent public response to the scientific article. Using KH Coder, all text was first pre-processed in order to eliminate stop words (e.g., ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’), extract the root form of words (i.e., lemmatisation), and determine the part-of-speech (i.e., noun, verb, adjective) of each word. Texts were analysed according to category (original article, press release, media coverage, public response) and top frequency words for each grouping were identified (Table 1\n",
       "). Word co-occurrence networks based on the top frequency words were then created in order to further understand patterns in the ways people communicated their opinions and reactions to the original scientific article. Word co-occurrence networks are a well-established and commonly employed content analysis technique (e.g., Danowski, 1993; Osgood, 1959) used to describe the association between words in a text. KH Coder follows the technique developed by Fruchterman and Reingold (1991) to draw networks (See Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). For each word co-occurrence network created with KH Coder, the size of the nodes indicates word frequency, the thickness of lines (edges) connecting nodes indicates the strength of the connection between word pairs, and colour of nodes indicates the different communities or themes within the text of the responses that were identified using the random walk method (Pons & Latapy, 2005). For this study, the level of analysis was paragraph rather than sentence, as paragraphs represent a natural segmentation structure for texts and provide for more holistic topic contextualisation (Bourgeois et al., 2015). Three categories of text (original article, media coverage and public reaction) were analysed separately by pooling all texts within each group. The original article included 130 paragraphs, while there were 1065 combined paragraphs of media coverage, and 3364 public comments (with each separate comment considered a paragraph for analysis purposes, regardless of comment length).\n",
       "Next, we used the SentiStrength program (Thelwall et al., 2010) to classify the sentiment for each set of text collected. SentiStrength was developed using words found on the MySpace social network, making this program particularly suitable for rating the short and informal text captured in social media. Importantly, SentiStrength can detect sarcasm and interpret basic emoticons. A separate score for positive (1 = weak, 5 = strong) and negative sentiment (−1 = weak, −5 = strong) was derived for each paragraph of text, and then the average sentiment was calculated for each text source. A net sentiment score was also calculated as the difference between positive and negative sentiment scores. The distributions of overall positive, negative, and net sentiment scores for each text source are reported in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, with each text source further categorised by type (media coverage, newspaper/blog comments, Reddit comments, Twitter comments, YouTube/Facebook comments).\n",
       "For the qualitative analysis we conducted a theoretically informed thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). This method was selected as being appropriate as it has been argued to be a useful method for large qualitative data sets and more specifically datasets from multiple and varying sources (Terry et al., 2017). While discourse analysis was also considered, it was decided that as the aims of the qualitative analysis was to enrich the quantitative analysis, discourse analysis would not be appropriate given its in-depth focus on specifics, rather than providing the analysis with an account of the overarching themes present in the data set (Potter & Wetherell, 1987).\n",
       "To conduct the thematic analysis we followed the six steps (1. familiarising yourself with the data; 2. generating initial codes; 3. searching for themes; 4. reviewing themes; 5. defining and naming themes; 6. producing the report) suggested by Braun and Clarke (2006). For example, after reading and re-reading the corpus of data several times, a line-by-line analysis was undertaken on printed versions of the data with initial codes (e.g. reference to sex, reference to driverless car) noted in the margins and highlighted in the text. Following this, the data and codes were re-read to establish if there were overarching themes (e.g. constructions of sex workers) that could be used to cluster and organise the individual codes. The themes were then reviewed to examine if there were any that needed to be incorporated together, or split apart. In what follows, we present the key findings from our analysis; this presentation incorporates the quantitative and qualitative findings to provide a rich and triangulated account of our qualitative and quantitative data (Olsen, 2004).\n",
       "The original scientific article was available online on November 1st, 2018, with an initial press release on November 6th. Six days later there was a spike in coverage on websites, blogs, video and television, highlighting the ways in which communication of the scientific article manifested through different mediums at different points in time (Fig. 2\n",
       ").\n",
       "Our analysis points to the way that sex is operationalised by the media to generate interest and hype. ‘Sex’ does not appear on the word frequency list for the original scientific article but is the second most frequently used word in the media headlines with 44 references in just 77 headlines (Table 1). While ‘sex’ therefore appears in 57% of the media headlines and has 428 mentions in the reader comments, the original article only mentions ‘sex’ briefly (three occurrences in one paragraph), and once in a quote provided for the press release of 472 words. Indeed, it was not just the media headlines that drew on ‘sex’ to capture the attention of readers, it was also central to the narratives of the media reporting, despite this reporting being based on a scientific article that only mentioned ‘sex’ momentarily. As the following extracts from media articles highlight:\n",
       "\n",
       "Nearly 60% of all Americans have had sex in cars. Just wait until the cars can drive themselves. (Fastcompany.com)\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "On its 13th page, a forthcoming paper in the journal Annals of Tourism Research makes a bold prophecy: People are going to have sex in driverless cars—and probably sell it, too. (QZ.com)\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Self-driving vehicles will encourage people to have sex in cars and could lead to Amsterdam-style “red light districts on wheels,” according to a new study.(Huffington Post)\n",
       "\n",
       "Reference to the ‘red light district’ in the final quotation was also noted in the word search with the noun ‘brothel’ featuring in 18 (23%) of the headlines, despite not featuring in the top word frequency list for the original article. Indeed, the original article did not use the word ‘brothel’ at all. In addition to the word ‘brothel’, the sex industry and sex workers were central to the media narratives constructed in relation to the original research on autonomous vehicles and the impacts these might have on urban tourism. What is important here is that sex was minimally presented as an act of love, rather it was presented as something negatively experienced through sex work, thus drawing on a well-established media tactic of creating a moral panic (Burns & Crawford, 1999). Further, the use of the statement ‘a bold prophecy’ presents a reality in which the future (sex in driverless cars) is presented with certainty, yet its effects remain uncertain. Such construction of a sexualised but uncertain and panic-ridden future offers an attempt to draw in readers and constructs the future as an effect of market-oriented attempts at increasing media impact. It is this ‘clickbait’ (Blom & Hansen, 2015) that developed as a central theme in the data obtained from the online media articles:\n",
       "\n",
       "Brothels could move into self-driving cars, British academics predict. (The Telegraph)\n",
       "\n",

       "Sex workers could soon trade in the pay-by-the-hour motel room for the backseat of an autonomous vehicle (AV)—like a naughty version of Uber or Lyft. (Futurism.com)\n",
       "\n",
       "This is in line with the notion that ‘sex sells’ (Blair et al., 2006) and that the communication of science is not as factual as the public might be led to believe (c.f. Mehr, 2015). Indeed, the focus on urban tourism, tourists, mobility and travel do not feature in the top ten words used in the media headlines despite constituting the focus of the original scientific article, in which sex was only a passing reference. However, there were instances in which media articles did make a clearer attempt to report a balanced reading of the scientific article, though it was also apparent that such examples were from sources outside of mainstream journalism. As the following highlights:\n",
       "\n",
       "The study by academics from the University of Surrey and the University of Oxford suggests that connected, autonomous vehicles (CAVs) could potentially create new tourism experiences and create a range of benefits, but could also add to congestion and cause job losses. (Article, ITP.net)\n",
       "\n",
       "Here the future is once again, albeit more explicitly, presented with varying levels of certainty and uncertainty (Anderson, 2010). Certainty in the sense that two possible ‘futures’ are presented, uncertainty in the sense that these are ‘potentials’ and ‘could[s]’, reflecting that a diverse range of future possibilities beyond those that are regime hyped do resonate with the media.\n",
       "Finally, there was one example in which an open reflection on the sensationalising of sex was reflected in the article's narrative:\n",
       "\n",
       "Actually, the only startling thing about this study — at least for a paid cynic like Yours Truly — is that it's hard to believe such titillating predictions are making headlines. Humans started having sex in cars pretty much right after the automobile was invented. The only difference is that now, thanks to the wonders of connected, self-driving software, you don't have to be parked and you don't have to climb into the back seat. As for transactional connubial relations being conducted in four-wheel vehicles, I'm pretty sure that's not a recent invention. (Toyota Auto News)\n",
       "\n",
       "This informant depicts the future as containing both elements of the present and changes that will likely improve on the present. This suggests the future will not be fundamentally different but contain re-configured aspects of the present and thus perhaps eliminates any need for concern. Hype, therefore, as controversy, alters seemingly stable social dynamics by exposing competing interests that frame diverging expectations for autonomous vehicles in relation to everyday practices and produces the future as heterogenous effects (Jóhannesson et al., 2015).\n",
       "The word co-occurrence network for the original scientific article is visually represented as Fig. 3\n",
       "and reveals several patterns in the text. First, the size of the circles indicate that the most frequently occurring words are ‘urban’, ‘tourism’, and ‘CAV’ (connected and autonomous vehicle) which of course encapsulate the topic of the article. Interestingly, the network analysis reveals that there are a total of eight distinct subgraphs or ‘themes’ of associated words. These ‘themes’ might represent a commonly occurring phrase, such as ‘autonomous vehicle’ and ‘night-time economy’. Another theme coincides with the methods sections of the article where words such as ‘study’, ‘approach’, ‘imagining’ and ‘analysis’ frequently occur in the same paragraphs. It is also interesting to observe that there are relatively few connections between words in different ‘themes’.\n",
       "Examination of the word co-occurrence network for the media coverage (including the press release) shown as Fig. 4\n",
       "instantly reveals a dramatically different text structure compared to the original article. It is clear that there are several ‘themes’ communicated by the media, such as the article's authors and their affiliations, and where the original article was published. Similar to the text of the scientific article, the phrase ‘autonomous vehicle’ is frequently observed. However, there are three clear themes related to activities that dramatically expand upon the ‘night-time economy’ theme of the scientific article. ‘Drug’, ‘surveillance’, and ‘passenger’ form the core of one theme, while ‘prostitution’, ‘legal’, ‘illegal’, and ‘red’ ‘light’ ‘district’ indicate other topics emphasised in the media's coverage. Just as interesting as the themes observed, are the themes not observed. The original scientific article's themes of ‘tourist’ ‘travel’ ‘public’ ‘transport’ and ‘industry’ ‘implication’ ‘potential’ ‘opportunity’ are not reflected at all in the media's coverage.\n",
       "Finally, Fig. 5\n",
       "depicts the word co-occurrence network of the public's response to the media's coverage of the scientific article. While the common theme of ‘autonomous vehicle’ is again observed in this network, the overall structure of this network is significantly different from those of the original article and the media's coverage. A total of 11 different ‘themes’ emerge. Frequently occurring phrases, such as ‘day’ ‘old’, ‘read’ the ‘article’, and ‘water’ is ‘wet’ are identified within the public's response. The most frequently used words are now ‘car’, ‘sex’, and ‘people’ which form the core of a major theme consistent with the media's coverage. It is also interesting to see other themes emerge such as ‘Uber’ ‘service’, ‘human’ ‘driver’ ‘accidents’, ‘man’ ‘woman’ ‘robot’, and ‘technology’ ‘improvement’. It is clear that the article and its subsequent media coverage have captured the public's interest and imagination and inspired a wide variety of discussions.\n",
       "The blue bars depicted in Fig. 6\n",
       "show that the media coverage of the original scientific article reproduces its content in a more negative than positive light. Further, it is clear from the sentiment analysis that all other sources of coverage (e.g. comments on the media articles) are positioned on the more positive side of the neutral 0.0. This overall trend shall now be unpacked in more detail in terms of positive and negative sentiment.\n",
       "Across the corpus of data, newspaper/blog and social media comments were generally more positive than media coverage (Fig. 7\n",
       "). Although we highlighted earlier that sensationalism and moral panic are specific strategies the mainstream media often adopt to increase readership, there were examples where media article coverage was positive. As the following examples highlight:\n",

       "\n",
       "Throughout the above extracts, positive sentiment flows through the accounts in terms of possible future futures including improved efficiency, comfort, and the opportunity to engage in sexual activities while driving evoked in regime hype. In addition, the possible futures include a wide range of leisure practices that offer opportunities for self-fashioning and consumption both of which resonate well with the public (Adam & Groves, 2007).\n",
       "While the above highlights some of the occurrences whereby autonomous vehicles were understood and represented in a positive light, as the sentiment analysis shows, the positivity surrounding them was largely led by those commenting on the media articles and videos. As the following user comments highlight, the suggestion of possibly having sexual intercourse in driverless cars was well received by the public imagination:\n",

       "Inherent throughout the above is how autonomous vehicles are made meaningful by imagining them as juxtaposed between daily practices (i.e. commuting) and sexualised acts. This functions to reinforce an imagination that the future will be different and better and thus helps position autonomous vehicles as potentially desirable.\n",
       "However, it was not just possible sexual benefits that captured the public's positive imagination, but also the broader potential travel and tourism advantages, despite these often being ignored in the media coverage. As the following Reddit reader comments:\n",
       "\n",
       "This has been my life goal since I found out self-driving RVs could be a thing. Imagine gassing up, going to sleep, and waking up parked in an entirely new and different place. I would travel every single night.\n",

       "Here autonomous vehicles are constructed in the future as an innovation that will be radically different and better and not, for instance, a development that would suggest simply a new stage in the evolution of the car (i.e. incremental innovation).\n",
       "There was a considerable amount of negative sentiment throughout the data (Fig. 8\n",
       "). While this was more prominent in the media coverage, it featured across the different data mediums. Although there were some examples of the negative impacts of autonomous vehicles on urban tourism raised in the original scientific article, negative sentiment predominately functioned through the following themes: negative constructions of sex work, potential for terrorism and an anti-academic position.\n",
       "Prostitution, brothels, pornography and the sex trade more generally have been socially constructed in a negative light across societies throughout modern history. However, this understanding of sexual acts as negative has not always been the dominant construction with various sexual relationships and acts understood positively in antiquity (Foucault, 1992). Prominent in the data was the construction that sex in driverless vehicles per se was not the issue, but rather it was the construction of sex work that enabled the negative connotations of prostitution as an illegitimate form of employment. As the following media articles and user comment highlight:\n",

While sex in cars is familiar and there are brothels in the present, the mobilisation of sex work represents a new kind of threat to social life.\n",
       "Of the negative sentiment expressed in relation to autonomous vehicles was the potential that a driverless car might offer to possible acts of terrorism. As with sex work, this potential issue was only mentioned briefly in the original scientific article but appeared to capture the imagination of the media articles and also some of the comments in response to these, along with comments on social media:\n",

       "They also pose a major security risk if terrorists choose to plough unoccupied vehicles into crowded urban areas, a new report has warned(Article, The Daily Mail)\n",
       "\n",
       "In a similar light to the negative future presented through sex work above, here the potential for terrorism, when compared to positive sentiments above, suggests the future can be understood through a different set of interdependencies, in this case terrorism and tourism. Such an imagined future both threatens and offers opportunities for liberal democracies. In addition, through reference to ‘Muslims’, ‘mosque[s]’, ‘Westminster’ and ‘terrorists’ there is also an element of Othering here that links the imagined future of autonomous vehicles to security regimes in the present, including racist tropes and Islamophobia.\n",
       "As is often the case when analysing comments made by the public towards research conducted by academics (e.g. Cohen et al., 2018) there was a strong anti-academic rhetoric throughout the data. Such negativity has been argued to function as a strategy for denial within the broader context of ‘fake news’ and recent high profile political discrediting of the value of academic research in relation to climate change (e.g. De Pryck & Gemenne, 2017). As the following comments highlight:\n",
       "\n",
       "I remember being a child in the seventies stuck on a coach in Blackpool for the lights. So I don't believe these academics have been thorough in their research. i.e. they are thick.

Just because some sexually frustrated academics can't get their minds out of the gutter and choose to project their own thoughts and desires on to the rest of the population, it doesn't make them prophets. (User comment, The Washington Post)\n",
       "\n",
       "This final extract can be understood through notions of shadowcasting in that the individual commenting is actively attempting to cast doubt on the ‘research’ presented through the questioning of its ‘scientific meaning’. Here the public is not the passive recipient of knowledge but is engaging in the uncertain and contested landscape of the emergence of autonomous vehicles to suggest that the ‘sexually frustrated academics…choose to project their own thoughts and desires’ as opposed to engaging in what might have constituted a traditionally ‘scientific’ endeavour.\n",
       "While anti-academic rhetoric is disconcerting, the findings cast shadows back onto the original paper that enriches understanding beyond framing the future for publics. A media agenda-setting approach to sensationalisation, for instance, would offer a binary nuance to regime narratives of certainty and technological progress by demonstrating that autonomous vehicles may bring some uncertain negative moral consequences like prostitution. This suggests that certainty is valued in innovation while uncertainty is negative and to be avoided through governance, and perhaps research needs to expand beyond technical progress to look at the actual potential for moral regressions to reassure the public.\n",
       "Instead, by analysing the future as a de-naturalised category from which diverse actors construct their own meaning and often paradoxical associations with practices in everyday life, shadowcasting demonstrates how uncertain futures are understood as both a source of creativity for new forms of consumption and a threat. In constructing the future as a disruption, publics imagine innovation happening in relation to a multiplicity of emerging, interdependent connections and unforeseeable events like terrorist attacks, but also for example, the current Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, by questioning media and academic discourse, publics can contribute to the research process by pointing to new anticipatory questions, in this case, how can innovation be open to and create the possibility for sex in cars, and new tourism experiences, while preventing prostitution and terrorism without diminishing either? In addition, because the future is imagined as different from the past, shadowcasting reveals that researchers may not wish to rely on analysing the past to know the future of autonomous vehicles but will require a constant readiness to identify other possible ways in which significantly different futures are emerging in relation to new events (Anderson, 2010).\n",
       "This paper contributed an understanding of the nexus between tourism research and its media dissemination that has been lacking in tourism scholarship. Moving away from the dominant focus on the implications of media reporting for destination image and how the tourism sector is framed, we instead revealed how tourism research itself can be bound up in the act of future-making through media reporting. To do so, we developed the concept of shadowcasting, a post-structuralist methodological orientation that shows how academic research dissemination through the media, and public comments on that media reporting, are co-constitutive actors in processes of imagining possible futures. This is akin to how when shadows are cast upon objects, they create a sense of presence on the objects they encounter, as well as altering our perception of the objects as they contact them, while simultaneously making other ideas less apparent.\n",
       "In this paper, we empirically demonstrated the multiple ways that media reporting, and public comments on this reporting – of one specific academic paper on autonomous vehicles and tourism – emerged and diverged from the original paper. In doing so, we revealed the ways that media reporting, in its various manifestations, might contribute to the construction and perpetuation of hype and/or disappointment, underpinned by various logics and discourses. The media, various publics, scientific research, and university communication teams thus become key actors in the innovation process, offering layers of interpretation and frames of potential futures which connect between the niche, existing regime and landscape, across a variety of temporal and spatial scales. We showed how sensationalist discourse is operationalised (in this context related to sex work), with the potential to affect heterogeneous expectations of what autonomous vehicles might do – and what futures they might be bound up within. The role of the media within sociotechnical transitions is complex, occurring across the three levels of the multi-level perspective (Geels, 2002). Future research could productively examine the dynamics of these interactions across the niche, regime and landscape levels. The media in this sense communicates multiple versions of scientific research, which may support or reject transition processes across the niche, regime and landscape. Our analysis however did not consider the extent to which these are embedded within particular geographical contexts, a vantage point which may be taken in future studies.\n",
       "Our findings demonstrated that far from being linear and predictive, the potential impacts of autonomous vehicles on urban tourism that captured media reporting and the public's imagination instead related to possibilities and anxieties linked to interdependent flows implicit to the complexity of globalisation, such as sex as leisure and illegal work and terrorism and tourism. This suggests that the media and publics (as reported through the media reporting comments) anticipate autonomous vehicles not necessarily through a lens of inevitability and desire for transport efficiency, but uncertainties that construct good and bad circulations whose effects potentially advance but also impede neoliberal economic life (Anderson, 2010).\n",
       "This paper also helped to elucidate how somewhat minor aspects of academic research – in this case sex and sex work – can be magnified through media reporting. This is perhaps more relevant for topics and themes that are apt to sensationalisation. Having sex in cars has long been associated with the car's capacity to engender a sense of freedom and emotional expressivity as a mobile yet private space (Featherstone et al., 2005), and these sentiments are repeated with reference to the emergence of autonomous vehicles. It thus came with little surprise that shortly after the media reporting on Cohen and Hopkins' (2019) (https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/autonomous-vehicles-could-shape-future-urban-tourism) paper, motor companies began to leverage upon ideas of intimacy in autonomous vehicles. In late November 2019, Tesla Motors introduced a ‘Romance Mode’ to their vehicles, shortly before their aspirational timeline to become fully self-driving. As Elon Musk tweeted: “After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car” (Lucchessi, 2018, n.p.). Inverse magazine (29/11/18) reported on a possible link between Tesla's ‘Romance Mode’ and the original academic research:\n",
       "\n",
       "The joke about the physical act of love in self-driving cars was the subject of actual academic research earlier this year: A paper in the journal Annals of Tourism Research…examined just how urban tourism, a hallmark of which is prostitution, would be changed by the self-driving car.\n",
       "\n",
       "While we cannot be certain of the link between the research dissemination and the emergence of ‘Romance Mode’, this anecdote illustrates the difficulty of evidencing the non-academic impact of research, wherein public engagement more often than not does not lead to linear impacts. Rather shadows are cast that co-constitute an imagined politics of the future, which informs anticipatory action and forms of governance in the present.\n",
       "This brings us back to the original question this paper's title posed: Self-driving sex cars? Yes, indeed.\n",
       "Our analysis in this paper has been limited to one particular case, an innovation still in development that may disrupt social life in the future. However, there are general dimensions from our case study that indicate other tourism research contexts prone to sensationalisation. These will include not just studies that disrupt dominant regimes or envision radical innovations, but also ones that threaten societal perceptions of tourism as a remedy for the ills of late-modern capitalism. Globalisation heightened the promise that tourism can be a remedy to social issues. To this end, we anticipate future studies that threaten the relationship between tourism and society, articulate key tensions in late-modern life and/or cast light on disruptive futures, will cast particularly strong shadows. This may include for instance studies of last-chance tourism, overtourism, flight shame, technological tourism unemployment and the darker sides of social media and technology use in tourist behaviour.\n",
       "Tourism research in at least these areas may be vulnerable to shadowcasting, even without actively reaching out to the media. In contrast, researchers can pro-actively leverage shadowcasting through press releases and media engagement, which is a positive prospect for empowering more impactful research. However, as other actors can cherry-pick, hype and distort findings, as shadowcasting is a co-constitutive process, tourism researchers are advised to proceed with caution.\n",

    "Although the relationship between IT use and salesperson performance remains primarily unsubstantiated, many organizations spend considerable human and financial resources in equipping their sales forces with IT. The cost of automating a sales force can be upwards of $3,500 per salesperson (Girard 1998), and more than 60% of all SFA projects have been unsuccessful (Rivers and Dart 1999). Meanwhile, companies continue to invest in SFA technology in the hopes that improving the speed and quality of information flow among the salespersons will ultimately deliver dividends (Speier and Venkatesh 2002). Marketing and information systems (IS) researchers alike have called for more research in the area of technology use and its impact on salesperson performance (Leigh and Marshall 2001, Marshall et al. 1999) and organizational performance generally (Venkatesh 2006).\n",

The cost of automating a sales force can be upwards of $3,500 per salesperson (Girard 1998), and more than 60% of all SFA projects have been unsuccessful (Rivers and Dart 1999). Meanwhile, companies continue to invest in SFA technology in the hopes that improving the speed and quality of information flow among the salespersons will ultimately deliver dividends (Speier and Venkatesh 2002). Marketing and information systems (IS) researchers alike have called for more research in the area of technology use and its impact on salesperson performance (Leigh and Marshall 2001, Marshall et al. 1999) and organizational performance generally (Venkatesh 2006).\n"
